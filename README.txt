For parts 1 and 2:
All the necessary code will be in the "PA2_code" folder.
The encoder and decoder can be run by entering "python main.py --model encoder"  and "python main.py --model decoder" respectively while in the PA2_code directory.
The sanity check should generate the attention maps, as well as returning the accuracy/perplexity for each epoch/100 iterations.
For part 3:
All the necessary code will be in the "PA2p3_code" folder.
instead of encoder and decoder its the same command but "p3encoder" and "p3decoder"
